  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant Game
    participant Dice
    Player->>Game: rollDice()

    Dice-->>Game: diceValue
    Game-->>Player: moveTo(diceValue)
    ```
  - Layered Architecture:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    Player --> Game
    Game --> Dice
    Game --> GameBoard
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 4: Climb a Ladder
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: When the player lands on a ladder, their token should be moved to the top of the ladder.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: The `Game` class should check if the player's new position is on a ladder. If so, update the position to the top of the ladder.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Game
    Game->>GameBoard: checkForLadder(newPosition)
    GameBoard-->>Game: newPosition
    ```
  - Layered Architecture:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    Game --> GameBoard
    GameBoard --> Ladder
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 5: Slide Down a Snake
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: When the player lands on a snake, their token should slide down to the bottom of the snake.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: Similar to climbing a ladder, the `Game` class should check if the player's new position is on a snake and update the position accordingly.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Game
    Game->>GameBoard: checkForSnake(newPosition)
    GameBoard-->>Game: newPosition
    ```
  - Layered Architecture:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    Game --> GameBoard
    GameBoard --> Snake
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 6: Win the Game
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: The game should notify the player when they reach the final square, thus winning the game.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: The `Game` class checks if the player has reached the final square after each move. If the condition is met, it triggers a win event.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Game
    Game->>GameBoard: checkWinCondition()
    GameBoard-->>Game: gameWon
    Game-->>Player: notifyGameWon()
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 7: Show Current Position
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: The player can view their current position on the board.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: The `Game` class should include a method to get the current position of the player's token.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Game
    Game->>GameBoard: getPosition(player)
    GameBoard-->>Game: position
    Game-->>Player: showPosition(position)
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 8: Play Multiplayer Game
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: The game should support playing against other players or the computer.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: Implement a `MultiplayerManager` class to handle turn-based gameplay among multiple players.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant MultiplayerManager
    participant Game
    MultiplayerManager->>Game: startTurn(player)
    Game->>MultiplayerManager: endTurn()
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 9: Save and Load Game
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: The game should allow saving the current game state and loading it later.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: Use a `GameStateManager` class to serialize the game state and save it to a file or database. A `GameLoader` class can be used to load the game state.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant GameStateManager
    participant Game
    GameStateManager->>Game: saveGameState()
    Game->>GameStateManager: loadGameState()
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 10: Display Game Rules
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: Before starting the game, the player should be able to read the rules of the game.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: Implement a `RulesManager` class that provides the game rules as text. The `Game` class should call `displayRules()` before the game starts.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Game
    participant RulesManager
    Game->>RulesManager: displayRules()
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 11: View Scores
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: During the game, the player should be able to view the current scores of all players.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: The `Game` class should maintain the scores for each player and provide a method to display them.

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Game
    Game->>Player: displayScores()
    ```

## 🧵 User Story 12: Reset the Game
- 🔹 **Functional Specifications**: The player should be able to reset the game to start over.
- 🔧 **Technical Specifications**: Implement a `resetGame()` method in the `Game` class, which resets the game state and prepares for a new game.
- 🏗 **Architecture Diagrams**
  - Sequence Diagram:
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    participant Game
    Game->>GameState: reset()
    GameState-->>Game: gameStateReset
    ```
